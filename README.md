# 2D LiDAR Simulation

This project simulates a 2D LiDAR system in Python using `matplotlib` for visualization. The simulation generates random obstacles in a defined environment, performs LiDAR scanning, and visualizes the results, including obstacle distances.

## Features
- Simulates a 2D LiDAR sensor that scans 360 degrees.
- Detects and visualizes obstacles within a specified range.
- Annotates detected obstacles with their distances from the LiDAR sensor.
- Visualizes the data in polar coordinates and a 2D map.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
